Murder at Moonview Motel

* \---

9PM
Rain can be heard outside from the lobby of the Moonview Motel. The lobby door chimes as {player_character_name} walks in. Another girl, roughly {player_character_name}'s age, is working the counter.
"Hey, {player_character_name}!"
*   "Heyyyyyyy!"
-   "Are you ready for your shift?"
*   "Yes."
    "That's the spirit."
    **  [Pump fist in the air.]
*   "No."
    "Not with that attitude you aren't!"
    **  [Laugh weakly.] "Heh."
-   "Now listen. There's a couple of important things I have to go over with you. I'm running late for my date, so I'm only going to say it once."
*   "OK..."
*   [Say nothing.] "..."
-   "First things first. Remember {maintenance_guy_name}? The new maintenance guy we hired?"

    "5'8, balding, looks a little like my dad?" -> remember_maintenance_guy
-   "Yeah, {maintenance_guy_name}! Well he still doesn't have a place to live. So right now the owner is letting him work for rent. He will be staying in room 6 tonight and indefinitely."
*   (good_deal)"That's a good deal for {maintenance_guy_name}."
    "Yeah, good to be {maintenance_guy_name}. <>
*   "I wish I could do that!"
    "We only have 6 rooms, remember? Also, you don't work nearly as hard as {maintenance_guy_name} does."
    **  "That's fair."

-   {not good_deal: "}Secondly, due to all of the rain, we haven't been able to turn off the sump-pump alarm outside of room 1."
*   "Oh no..."
-   "Yeah. I would try to avoid putting anyone there unless it was necessary. Apparently it's "infuriating"."
*   "I'd bet.["] Outside of room 1 you said?"
-   "Yes. Here, I'll mark it on the floor plan." {desk_girl_name} marks alarm next to room 1 with a red "X". "I know how annoying some of our customers can be. If you get too much lip again, don't hesitate to tell them they are never (Lobby door chimes as a family of three walks in.) WELCOME TO THE MOONVIEW MOTEL! Hi folks! Can I get you a room?"
-   Father: "Hi! Yes, please! We've been driving for most of the day, and we're glad we found this place."
{desk_girl_name}: "Happy to help!" {desk_girl_name} turns to {player_character_name}. "Hey, I really need to go. Can you place these people?"

*   "I was just about to ask!["] What's your name, son?"
-   Son: "{family_son_name}"
*   "Well, {family_son_name}, the Moonview Motel has some of the comfiest cots in the state."
-   {family_son_name}: "Thanks..."
*   "It's my pleasure, {family_son_name}.["] When I was your age and went on trips with my parents, I always wanted my own cot. My dad could shake the entire room with his snoring."
-   The mother laughs, {family_son_name} stares, wide-eyed, and the father looks at his shoes, embarrassed.
*   "A nice guy named {maintenance_guy_name} will bring the cot to you soon.["] Here's your key. Go ahead and get settled. Call me at any time. And don't worry, {family_son_name} – you get used to the snoring eventually."

The door bell dings as a policeman enters the lobby.
*   "{policeman_name}!"
-   {policeman_name} sighs. "...Just {policeman_personally_preferred_name} is fine, {player_character_name}. Haven't we talked about this?"
*   "Oh, yeah.["] Sorry, {policeman_name}!"
-   {policeman_name} sighs. "...Another night shift? Do you ask for these, or does your boss just not like you?"
*   "I prefer them."
*   "I ask for them[."], but you may be right about my boss."
-   "Why? You like the quiet?"
*   "That's a perk[."], but not the main reason. It's more so the people I run into. I see things come from people you don't see in the afternoon."
-   "Like what?"
*   "Well[..."], last night, an elderly couple came in around midnight. It was obvious that midnight was well beyond their bedtime. Anyways, the husband says under his breath, and I got to witness the meanest, most sadistic 15 minute fight a couple could ever have. At one point, they brought up a pet dog they owned in their 20s."
-   "Geez..."
*   "It got so bad[..."] they demanded two separate rooms. When I told them we only had one, the wife slept in the car. The husband couldn't talk her out of it."
-   "That's pretty bad."
*   "That's relatively normal!["] I've encountered so many strange things. Like, I just asked the new maintenance guy to call and check on me if he can't sleep.

// TODO: Check with john about "plot hole" note from script. Does it have to do with hearing "two thiings" earlier?
-   "Well, two things actually."
*   "Not the first time I've heard that tonight."
-   "Huh?"
*   "Nothing."
// Editor' note: for the tact choice, I went with the date option suggested in the original script notes.
-   "...Anyways. I, uh, was wondering if you are free any night next week."

-   {policeman_name} inhales deeply. "Very early this morning, there were a series of break-ins that were no doubt related."
*   "How do you know they were related?"
-   "Well... In each case, the residents were fatally beaten. We have no motive. We have no weapon. All we have are five victims across two homes and one motel room."
*   "Oh my..."
-   "Yeah. Not good."
*   "Why haven't I heard about this?"
    "While they happened somewhere between 3 – 4:30 AM, we didn't catch wind until around 9. One of the victims' boss called us after his no-show."
*   "Why are you telling me this?"
    "I didn't want to scare you, believe me! But I thought you should know because... well...," {policeman_name} looks down at his shoes, "each break-in occurred within a mile of this motel."

-   "I wish I could have. Looks like I'll be needing a room for the night."
*   "Don't you have to work?"
-   "The room isn't for me."

-   "As soon as I left here, I got a call from dispatch. A disturbance at the pub down the highway. Pretty routine, I thought."

-   "No, that was normal. But when I turned him over, I was looking into the scared eyes of {drunk_guy_name_full}."
*   "No..."
-   "I'm afraid so."
*   "{drunk_guy_name_nick}?"
-   "Mm-hmm. Our beloved mascot. The same {drunk_guy_name} that did back hand springs while you marched and I kept the bench warm."
*   "Oh dear..."
-   "Pretty sad. {drunk_guy_name} had it rough after high school."
*   "Yeah."
-   "Anyways, it's been about a year since I remember him doing anything like this. Can I put him up for the night? He's still a little drunk but he'll be okay. I don't want him to wake up in a jail cell."
*   "That's nice of you.["] Sure, I'll get him a room."

Second: "Yeah, thanks!"

-   "I said, THAT’S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS"
*   [Be harsh.] "What’s your name?"
    "Huh?"
    **  "WHAT’S YOUR NAME?"
    --  "T-Thomas..."
    **  "Well, T-Thomas...["] This information might be shocking and brand new to you, but you aren’t the only one having a bad night. I’ve been dealing with the police, a possible killer on the loose, a drunk classmate who should PROBABLY be in jail right now, and a maintenance guy who is treating me like his helpless, 8 year old daughter all because I asked him to 'check on me once or twice'. On top of that, I’ll have worked for 14 hours today. I had to take a second job washing dishes just to pay rent, and it’s another 14 hour day tomorrow. I get that a few of us aren't where we want to be. But DON’T throw that anger on someone else. It’s hard enough already for them. Here is your key, Thomas. Get some sleep.
    --  "..." Thomes leaves.
*   (young_man_open_up) [Be real.] "Why are you talking to me like this?"
    "Like what?"
    **  "I think you know exactly what I’m talking about.["] I want to make your visit as cozy as possible, and I have tried to do nothing but that since the moment you walked in.
    --  "..."
    **  "What’s your name?"
    --  "...Thomas."
    **  "Hello, Thomas.["] I’m {player_character_name}."
    --  "Hi..."
    **  "What’s on your mind, Thomas?"
    --  "Well..." Thomas tells a sad story. Thomas had one real friend in the entire city – his roommate. His friend was soft and ate a lot of Thomas’s anger. Unfortunately, Thomas never got the help he needed and Thomas’s anger became too much for his friend. His friend kicked Thomas out and hasn’t talked to him since.
    **  "I’m sorry, Thomas."
    --  "..."
    **  "I think your friend still cares about you[."], but it sounds like he needs some time to sort things out. Without you. ...Do you think it would be wise to get some help in the meantime?
    --  "...Yeah. Maybe so."
    **  "Is there anyone you can stay with in the meantime?["] Hotel life can be expensive."
    --  "Maybe. A lot of people wouldn’t put up with me like my friend did. ...I may need to change a few things. ...Thanks."
    **  [Smile.] "My pleasure."
    --  "..."
    **  "Well, you’re welcome at the Moonview Motel anytime.["] And since this night's halfway over, I’ll only charge you half-price for the night. Sound fair?
    --  "Yeah." Thomas smiles. "That sounds fair."
    **  "Have a good night[."], Thomas. Get some rest. Don’t hesitate to call if you need anything.
    --  Thomas leaves.

{policeman_name} enters the lobby.

*   "Hi, {policeman_personally_preferred_name}!"
-   "Hello."
*   "...Is everything ok?"
-   {policeman_name} sighs. "I hope so, but it might not be."
*   "What’s wrong?["] Are we in danger?"
-   "No, no... I think we’ll be ok. But I think I may have made a pretty big mistake."
*   "Oh?"
-   "Well, I ran those background checks like I said I would. And they turned out mostly ok."
*   "Mostly?"
-   "As it turns out, three years ago a case went unsolved. A woman was inside her house one night when a stranger broke in. She claimed he attacked her and even tried to strangle her. Luckily for her, a neighbor was walking by at just the right time and heard her screaming. Before the murder could happen, the neighbor kicked down the door. By the time he reached the kitchen, the intruder had bolted out the back door and was well into the woods."
*   "Who was the intruder?"
-   "We don’t know for sure, but the woman’s description was a near perfect match of..."
*   "...Of?"
-   "Charlie."
*   "No["]..."
-   "I'm afraid so."
*   "Why wasn’t he arrested?"
-   "We brought him in for questioning, but he denied all charges. His friend gave a solid alibi, and we just didn’t have any proof. And I believed him, too. Just like that. On top of all of this, the victim was a drug addict with a much worse record than him. It was her word against his, and she had previously lied in court on two separate occasions."
*   "So[..."], you think Charlie killed these people last night?"
-   "I don’t know. But I’m damn certain he won’t be staying here another minute. Sorry to put you through all this."

-   "What’s wrong?"
*   "Are you sure it’s Charlie?["] I know he’s had a rough decade since we graduated, but do you really think he could do this?"
-   "...As his friend, no I don’t. But based off of the facts, yes I do. But none of that is important right now – I need to get him out of here."
*   "I understand.["] Can you do me one favor before you go?"
-   "What’s that?"
*   "I want to make sure everyone is ok.["] Can you gently knock on everyone’s door?"
-   "...I don’t want to do that."
*   "Why?"
-   "You want me to go back and knock on everyone’s door at 4 in the morning? I don’t think they’ll like that."
*   "What do you mean by "go back"?"
-   "Uh...I already checked on them earlier."
*   "When?"
-   "Are we playing 20 questions?!"
*   [Say nothing.] "..."
*   "Just wondering.["] I’m somewhat responsible for this too, you know."
-   "I need you to let me do my job."
*   "Well could you still check?"
    "You’re killing me." {policeman_name} sighs. "FINE. One quick check. Please go wait inside, and don’t come out."

{policeman_name} enters the lobby.
*   "Well??"
-   "Nothing to worry about, at least I THINK. No one answered their doors."
*   "Really?["] No one?"
-   "Really. No one."
*   "That’s strange.["] Did you knock very loudly?"
-   {policeman_name} sighs. "Yes, {player_character_name}. I knocked at a level they could hear if they weren’t fast asleep. Only person who responded was the little boy in room {get_room_number_by_occupant(FAMILY_ID)}. He didn’t answer the door, just met me at the window. He looked scared, so I winked at him and motioned for him to go back to sleep."
*   "Oh, you saw the boy?"
-   "...Did I not just say that? Yes! Now is that all?"
*   "I just think it’s kind of strange that you saw the boy.["] He and his parents left a few hours ago."
-   "No they didn’t, they’re-"
*   "They’re what?"
-   "..."
*   "On the directory I gave you?"
-   "..."
*   "Did you really knock on everyone’s door?"
-   "...No."
*   "Why?"
-   "Because I was scared."
*   "Scared of what?"
-   "Scared of being recognized."
*   "By who?"
// TODO: does the player know who Jared is.
-   "...By Thomas. And Jared."
*   "When did they see you?"
// TODO: clarify woman in black.
-   "When I tried to break in to the woman’s room. And when I tried to break in to Pete's room."
*   "..."
-   "..."
*   "Oh, Rick..."
-   "Surprise."
*   "And you were going to pin the whole thing on Charlie?"
-   "Charlie may have killed that drug addict for all I know, and he could’ve murdered those people last night."
// TODO: what does this mean?
*   "That wasn’t you?"
-   "No." {policeman_name} pauses. "But I’ve thought about it for a while. And I thought tonight was my chance."
*   "...Well what now?"
-   "Well...I suppose I could just kill you now. Throw you in that pool, plant some evidence that it was Charlie, and leave him in his room. With what happened three years ago, he won’t get out of this one."
*   "Yeah, you could.["] But you won’t."
-   "Why’s that?"
*   "Because I know you too well."
    "...Hm?"

-
*   "Remember in 4th grade[..."] when I broke the teacher’s window and was terrified of my parents finding out? You took all of the punishment for me, knowing there would be much worse waiting for you at your home. And I didn’t even ask you to. In fact, I think I asked you not to."

// TODO: not clear to me how Tracy knows that these guys prevented the murders.

*   "I have a plan.["] First of all, take {drunk_guy_name} in. The thought of him being here is a little scary. But afterwards, please turn yourself in. Your coworkers, your friends – they will find you help. I will find you help." {player_character_name} pauses.
